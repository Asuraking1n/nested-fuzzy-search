## Description

**Nested Fuzzy Search** is a lightweight and customizable JavaScript library for performing fuzzy search operations on deeply nested objects and arrays. By leveraging the Levenshtein distance algorithm, this package efficiently handles complex data structures and provides accurate similarity-based results.

## Features

- Recursive search through nested objects and arrays.
- Fuzzy matching using the Levenshtein distance algorithm.
- Customizable similarity threshold.
- Easy integration with JavaScript and TypeScript projects.
- Lightweight and dependency-free.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install nested-fuzzy-search
```

## Usage

### Importing the Package

Using ES6 imports:

```javascript
import { search } from 'nested-fuzzy-search';
```

### Example

Hereâ€™s how you can use `nested-fuzzy-search` to perform a fuzzy search on nested data:

```javascript
import { search } from 'nested-fuzzy-search';

const data = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Root Level",
  details: {
    created: "2024-12-10",
    modified: "2024-12-10",
    meta: {
      tags: ["root", "nested", "example"],
      author: {
        name: "John Doe",
        email: "johndoe@example.com",
      },
    },
  },
  children: [
    {
      id: 2,
      name: "Level 2 - A",
      type: "Category",
      attributes: {
        visibility: "public",
        tags: ["level2", "category"],
      },
    },
  ],
};

const query = "John";
const threshold = 0.5; // Minimum similarity score

const results = search(data, query, threshold);
console.log(results);
```

### Output

```javascript
[
  { path: ".details.meta.author.name", value: "John Doe", score: 1 },
]
```

## API

### `search(data, query, threshold = 0.6)`

Performs a fuzzy search on the provided nested data.

#### Parameters:
- **`data`**: The nested object or array to search.
- **`query`**: The search string.
- **`threshold`**: The minimum similarity score (default: `0.6`).

#### Returns:
An array of results, each containing:
- `path`: The path to the matched value.
- `value`: The matched string.
- `score`: The similarity score.

### How it Works
1. The library flattens the nested structure into a list of paths and string values.
2. It calculates the similarity score between the query and each string value using the Levenshtein distance.
3. Results with scores above the threshold are returned, sorted by relevance.

## Testing

Run unit tests using Jest:

```bash
npm test
```
